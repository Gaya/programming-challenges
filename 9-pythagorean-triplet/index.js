/*
 A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,

 a2 + b2 = c2
 For example, 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2.

 There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
 Find the product abc.

//a2 + b2 = c2, a + b + c = 1000

var outcome = 1000;

console.log(Math.pow(outcome, 2));
